Fast Bayesian estimation and forecasting of age-specific rates.

## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("bayesiandemography/bage")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(bage)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
