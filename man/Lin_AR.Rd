\usage{
Lin_AR(
  n_coef = 2,
  s = 1,
  shape1 = 5,
  shape2 = 5,
  mean_slope = 0,
  sd_slope = 1,
  along = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_coef}{Number of lagged terms in the
model, ie the order of the model. Default is \code{2}.}

\item{s}{Scale for the innovations in the
AR process. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{shape1, shape2}{Parameters for beta-distribution prior
for coefficients. Defaults are \code{5} and \code{5}.}

\item{mean_slope}{Mean in prior for slope
of line. Default is 0.}

\item{sd_slope}{Standard deviation in the prior for
the slope of the line. Larger values imply
steeper slopes. Default is 1.}

\item{along}{Name of the variable to be used
as the 'along' variable. Only used with
interactions.}

\item{con}{Constraints on parameters.
Current choices are \code{"none"} and \code{"by"}.
Default is \code{"none"}. See below for details.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"bage_prior_linar"}.
}
\description{
Use a line or lines with autoregressive
errors to model a main effect
or interaction. Typically used with time.
}
\details{
If \code{Lin_AR()} is used with an interaction,
separate lines are constructed along
the 'along' variable, within each combination
of the 'by' variables.

The order of the autoregressive errors is
controlled by the \code{n_coef} argument. The
default is 2.

Argument \code{s} controls the size of the innovations.
Smaller values tend to give smoother estimates.

Argument \code{sd_slope} controls the slopes of
the lines. Larger values can give more steeply
sloped lines.
}
\section{Mathematical details}{


When \code{Lin_AR()} is used with a main effect,

\deqn{\beta_1 = \alpha + \epsilon_1}
\deqn{\beta_j = \alpha + (j - 1) \eta + \epsilon_j, \quad j > 1}
\deqn{\alpha \sim \text{N}(0, 1)}
\deqn{\epsilon_j = \phi_1 \epsilon_{j-1} + \cdots + \phi_{\mathtt{n\_coef}} \epsilon_{j-\mathtt{n\_coef}} + \varepsilon_j}
\deqn{\varepsilon_j \sim \text{N}(0, \omega^2),}

and when it is used with an interaction,

\deqn{\beta_{u,1} = \alpha_u + \epsilon_{u,1}}
\deqn{\beta_{u,v} = \eta (v - 1) + \epsilon_{u,v}, \quad v = 2, \cdots, V}
\deqn{\alpha_u \sim \text{N}(0, 1)}
\deqn{\epsilon_{u,v} = \phi_1 \epsilon_{u,v-1} + \cdots + \phi_{\mathtt{n\_coef}} \epsilon_{u,v-\mathtt{n\_coef}} + \varepsilon_{u,v},}
\deqn{\varepsilon_{u,v} \sim \text{N}(0, \omega^2).}

where
\itemize{
\item \eqn{\pmb{\beta}} is the main effect or interaction;
\item \eqn{j} denotes position within the main effect;
\item \eqn{u} denotes position within the 'along' variable of the interaction; and
\item \eqn{u} denotes position within the 'by' variable(s) of the interaction.
}

The slopes have priors
\deqn{\eta \sim \text{N}(\mathtt{mean\_slope}, \mathtt{sd\_slope}^2)}
and
\deqn{\eta_u \sim \text{N}(\mathtt{mean\_slope}, \mathtt{sd\_slope}^2).}

Internally, \code{Lin_AR()} derives a value for \eqn{\omega} that
gives \eqn{\epsilon_j} or \eqn{\epsilon_{u,v}} a marginal
variance of \eqn{\tau^2}. Parameter \eqn{\tau}
has a half-normal prior
\deqn{\tau \sim \text{N}^+(0, \mathtt{s}^2).}

The correlation coefficients \eqn{\phi_1, \cdots, \phi_{\mathtt{n\_coef}}}
each have prior

\deqn{0.5 \phi_k - 0.5 \sim \text{Beta}(\mathtt{shape1}, \mathtt{shape2}).}
}

\section{Constraints}{


With some combinations of terms and priors, the values of
the intercept, main effects, and interactions are
are only weakly identified.
For instance, it may be possible to increase the value of the
intercept and reduce the value of the remaining terms in
the model with no effect on predicted rates and only a tiny
effect on prior probabilities. This weak identifiability is
typically harmless. However, in some applications, such as
forecasting, or when trying to obtain interpretable values
for main effects and interactions, it can be helpful to increase
identifiability through the use of constraints.

Current options for constraints are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"none"} No constraints. The default.
\item \code{"by"} Only used in interaction terms that include 'along' and
'by' dimensions. Within each value of the 'along'
dimension, terms across each 'by' dimension are constrained
to sum to 0.
