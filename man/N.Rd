\usage{
N(scale = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{scale}{A positive, finite number.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{bage_prior_norm}.
}
\description{
Prior in which units are drawn independently from a normal
distribution. The default prior for most terms.
}
\details{
The normal distribution has mean \code{0} and standard
deviation \code{s}.

\deqn{x \sim \text{N}(0, s^2)}

Standard deviation \code{s} is drawn from a half-normal
distribution,

\deqn{s \sim \text{N}^+(0, \text{scale}^2)}

(A half-normal distribution has the same shape as a normal
distribution, but is defined only for non-negative
values.)

The scale for the half-normal distribution defaults
to 1, but can be set to other values. Lower values
lead to more tightly concentrated
estimates for \code{x}, and higher values lead to less tightly
concentrated estimates.

\code{N()} is usually called within \code{\link[=set_prior]{set_prior()}}.
Other priors are \code{\link[=RW]{RW()}}, \code{\link[=RW2]{RW2()}}.
