\title{Second-Order Random Walk Prior with Seasonal Effect}
\usage{
RW2_Seas(n_seas, s = 1, s_seas = 1, along = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_seas}{Number of seasons}

\item{s}{Scale for prior for innovations in
the random walk. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{s_seas}{Scale for prior for innovations
in the seasonal effect. Default is \code{1}.
Can be \code{0}.}

\item{along}{Name of the variable to be used
as the "along" variable. Only used with
interactions.}
}
\value{
Object of class \code{"bage_prior_rw2seasvary"}
or \code{"bage_prior_rw2seasfix"}.
}
\description{
Use a second-oder random walk with
seasonal effects to model
a main effect, or use multiple second-order random walks,
each with their own seasonal effects,
to model an interaction.
A second-order random walk is effectively
a random walk with drift where the
drift term varies. It is typically
used with main effects or interactions
that involve time, where there are sustained
trends upward or downward.
}
\details{
If \code{RW2_Seas()} is used with an interaction,
separate series are used for
the "along" variable within
each combination of the
"by" variables.

Argument \code{s} controls the size of innovations in the random walk.
Smaller values for \code{s} tend to give smoother series.

Argument \code{n_seas} controls the number of \code{seasons}.
When using quarterly data, for instance,
\code{n_seas} should be \code{4}, and when using
monthly data, \code{n_seas} should be \code{12}.

By default, the magnitude of seasonal effects
can change over time. However, setting \code{s_seas}
to \code{0} produces seasonal effects that are fixed,
eg where "January" effect is the same every year,
the "Feburary" effect is the same every year, and so on.

\section{Mathematical details}{


When \code{RW2_Seas()} is used with a main effect,

\deqn{\beta_j = \alpha_j + \lambda_j}
\deqn{\alpha_j \sim \text{N}(2 \alpha_{j-1} - \alpha_{j-2}, \tau^2)}
\deqn{\lambda_j \sim \text{N}(\lambda_{j-n}, \omega^2),}

and when it is used with an interaction,

\deqn{\beta_{u,v} = \alpha_{u,v} + \lambda_{u,v}}
\deqn{\alpha_{u,v} \sim \text{N}(2 \alpha_{u,v-1} - \alpha_{u,v-2}, \tau^2),}
\deqn{\lambda_{u,v} \sim \text{N}(\lambda_{u,v-n}, \omega^2)}

where
\itemize{
\item \eqn{\pmb{\beta}} is the main effect or interaction;
\item \eqn{\alpha_j} or \eqn{\alpha_{u,v}} is an element of the random walk;
\item \eqn{\lambda_j} or \eqn{\lambda_{u,v}} is an element of the seasonal effect;
\item \eqn{j} denotes position within the main effect;
\item \eqn{v} denotes position within the "along" variable of the interaction;
\item \eqn{u} denotes position within the "by" variable(s) of the interaction; and
\item \eqn{n} is \code{n_seas}.
}

Parameter \eqn{\omega} has a half-normal prior
\deqn{\omega \sim \text{N}^+(0, \text{s\_seas}^2),}
where \code{s_seas} is provided by the user. If
\code{s_seas} is set to 0, then \eqn{\omega} is 0,
and the seasonal effects are fixed over time.

Parameter \eqn{\tau} has a half-normal prior
\deqn{\tau \sim \text{N}^+(0, \text{s}^2),}
where \code{s} is provided by the user.

\examples{
RW2_Seas(n_seas = 4)             ## seasonal effects evolve
RW2_Seas(n_seas = 4, s_seas = 0) ## seasonal effects fixed
