\arguments{
\item{n_comp}{Number of spline basis functions (components)
to use.}

Default is \code{1}.}

\item{sd}{Standard deviation in prior for first
element of random walk.}

\item{sd_slope}{Standard deviation in prior
for initial slope of random walk. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{along}{Name of the variable to be used
as the 'along' variable. Only used with
interactions.}

\item{con}{Constraints on parameters.
Current choices are \code{"none"} and \code{"by"}.
Default is \code{"none"}. See below for details.}

\value{
An object of class \code{"bage_prior_spline"}.

\description{
Use a p-spline (penalised spline) to model main
effects or interactions. Typically used with age,
but can be used with any variable where outcomes are
expected to vary smoothly from one element to the next.
}
\details{
If \code{Sp()} is used with an interaction,
separate splines are used for the 'along' variable within
each combination of the
'by' variables.
}
\section{Mathematical details}{


When \code{Sp()} is used with a main effect,

\deqn{\pmb{\beta} = \pmb{X} \pmb{\alpha}}

and when it is used with an interaction,

\deqn{\pmb{\beta}_u = \pmb{X} \pmb{\alpha}_u}

where
\itemize{
\item \eqn{\pmb{\beta}} is the main effect or interaction, with \eqn{J} elements;
\item \eqn{\pmb{\beta}_u} is a subvector of \eqn{\pmb{\beta}} holding
values for the  \eqn{u}th combination of the 'by' variables;
\item \eqn{J} is the number of elements of \eqn{\pmb{\beta}};
\item \eqn{U} is the number of elements of \eqn{\pmb{\beta}_u};
\item \eqn{X} is a \eqn{J \times n} or \eqn{V \times n} matrix of
spline basis functions; and
\item \eqn{n} is \code{n_comp}.
}

The elements of \eqn{\pmb{\alpha}} or \eqn{\pmb{\alpha}_u} are assumed
to follow a \link[=RW2]{second-order random walk}.
}

\section{Constraints}{


With some combinations of terms and priors, the values of
the intercept, main effects, and interactions are
are only weakly identified.
For instance, it may be possible to increase the value of the
intercept and reduce the value of the remaining terms in
the model with no effect on predicted rates and only a tiny
effect on prior probabilities. This weak identifiability is
typically harmless. However, in some applications, such as
forecasting, or when trying to obtain interpretable values
for main effects and interactions, it can be helpful to increase
identifiability through the use of constraints.

Current options for constraints are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"none"} No constraints. The default.
\item \code{"by"} Only used in interaction terms that include 'along' and
'by' dimensions. Within each value of the 'along'
dimension, terms across each 'by' dimension are constrained
to sum to 0.
