\title{Priors for Intercept, Main Effects, Interactions}
\description{
The models for rates, probabilities, or means
created with functions \code{\link[=mod_pois]{mod_pois()}}, \code{\link[=mod_binom]{mod_binom()}},
and \code{\link[=mod_norm]{mod_norm()}} always include an intercept,
and typically include main effects,
and interactions. Most models, for instance
include an age effect, and many include
and interaction between age and sex/gender,
or age and time.
}
\details{
The intercept, main effects, and interactions
all have prior models that capture the expected
behavior of the term. Current choices of prior
models are summarised here.

Priors with links to help have been implemented.
Priors without links are next in the queue for implementation.\tabular{llll}{
